This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games. Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention.

Almost all religions decree the magic power of pure water. On the other hand, probably all biological reactions occur in salty water. Water covers twothirds of our planet. At least to our experience, where there is water, there is life. Water is widely regarded as the ‘matrix of life’ which is not just a passive scaffold but also has many active roles in molecular biology. There are various scientific debates associated with water. For example, in the late 1960s, Russian chemist Boris Deryaguin and his colleagues claimed that polywater, a gel-like form of water, could be observed in small capillary tubes. Even more unbelievably, in the 1980s Benveniste and his collaborators proposed the notion of the ‘memory of water’, whereby the liquid water could allegedly be imprinted by biomolecular information which is now extensively used to justify homeopathy. In this module, we will explore how water, together with salts, shaped the emergence and evolution of life and also the students will have a full freedom to give your own opinions on the debates.

A business process is a collection of activities that creates an output that is of value to some customer. Business processes can be improved at any level of an organization or can be improved across multiple organizations. Typically, Business Process Redesign/Reengineering (BPR) uses information technology to enable business process change in order to reduce costs, improve service, and reduce cycle times. Several BPR methodologies exist. Most methodologies require the construction of an “As-Is” and “To-Be” model. This course will discuss the role of BPR in managing technology and the operational functions. The course will cover the strategic, operational and technological dimensions of BPR in the context of quality improvement, Information Technology and business operations. Case studies will provide real-world context for the concepts discussed in class. The course is designed to teach students BPR methodologies and modeling techniques that accompany the methodology. Students will identify an organization (or part of an organization) that needs improvement.

Augmenting the reading of sociolinguistic and cognitive science texts in this module, students will also learn how to collect and to analyze empirical evidence of language phenomena in order to more critically assess the claims of such texts.","mc":4,"preclusion":"Not applicable to USP modules.","lectures":{"6":{"1":[{"day":1,"start":"1800","end":"2000","weeks":0,"venue":"USP SR2"},{"day":4,"start":"1800","end":"2000","weeks":0,"venue":"USP SR2"}]}}},"UIS3921":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS3921R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS3922":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS3922R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS3923":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS3923R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS3924":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS3924R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS3931":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS3932":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS3933":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS3941":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS3942":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS4921":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS4921R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS4922":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS4922R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS4923":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS4923R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS4924":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS4924R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4,"prereq":"USP Student"},"UIS4931":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS4932":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS4933":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS4934":{"title":"INDEPENDENT STUDY MODULE","mc":4},"UIS4941":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS4942":{"title":"Independent Study Module","mc":4},"UIS5921R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4},"UIS5922R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4},"UIS5923R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4},"UIS5924R":{"title":"Independent Study Module (Ride-On)","mc":4},"UIT2201":{"title":"Computer Science & The I.T.

In this module we will retrace the key ideas that led Einstein to his formulation of the Special Theory of Relativity, and how the concepts evolved through various personalities to produce the elegant spacetime version of the theory, culminating in the General Theory of Relativity. Along the way we will see the practical application of the scientific method and clarify common misconceptions of the theory. We will also study the impact Relativity has had on science, technology, philosophy and culture, and have a peek at the research frontier, where gravity and quantum theory meet, to be aware of open problems. Synopsis Einstein’s insight was that time must be relative, in contrast to Newton’s assumption of an absolute time. Time dilation (“moving clocks run slow”) is easily derived from Einstein’s postulates and it immediately implies a range of related effects such as the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction. These phenomena are seen to be interconnected through the formulation of a Minkowskian spacetime, which unites, and generalizes, Euclid’s space with Newton’s time.

It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given. Registration for this one-year long module will be opened for a new intake of first-year students only in Semester 2 of each academic year.","mc":4,"lectures":{"6":{"1":[{"day":3,"start":"1900","end":"2100","weeks":0,"venue":"TP-GLR"}]}}},"UWC2101A":{"title":"Writing and Critical Thinking: Colonialism and Cosmopolitanism","desc":"This module teaches writing and critical thinking through a critical exploration of the notion of cosmopolitanism and its relation to colonialism.
